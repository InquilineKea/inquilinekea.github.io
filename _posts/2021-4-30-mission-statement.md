# On attracting people to the MAIN problem:

“what would you do if you could take effortless action from the rest of your life onwards”
Longevity: If longevity is the main problem you’re after and if you’re not focusing most of your time and attention into the problem, then why not?
Look at Laura Deming for instance, who has razor-clean inputs and does not need to rely on other people’s social approval because she HAS this social approval that allows her to not FOMO at important things in the world BECAUSE she is able to focus on things (this is why her computer-technical skills are not the best BECAUSE she has enough supporters to make her want to constantly focus on THE THING (aging) all the time [1]
[1] this may not be the truth but i am modeling a version of the “ideal protagonist”. Others speculate that it may not be Laura long-term b/c Laura’s pollution-free mind may be more uniquely suited for long-term fudamental biophysics reserch because her intelligence is high **and unique** enough that her mind IS more suited to non-aging-related-work (VC means you have to deal with SO MUCH BS and noise and much of it involves being non-original with research b/c you integrated inputs from a broader range of people/labs than do most mainstream reserchers). I don’t think I’m as good at theory/biophysics as Laura is, which I think makes some believe that the mantle has to be passed onto me IF laura does the thing and goes super-theoretical

Hugo is prodding me wondering why I'm only spending like 10% of my time on longevity-related thngs over the past month, when it is self-evidently STILL the only thing that matters [esp b/c my actions COULD still pivot much of GenZ towards caring about it "literally if only anyone could do it"], and I still play the infinite rouletee wheel of pursuing infinite spontaneity which obviously does not lend itself to long-work"

Also I need to be seen as competent and the easiest way to demosntrate it is BY WRITING THE DOC OF WHAT I WOULD DO BY THE ULTIMATE PROTAGONIST OF AGING

Ppl have told me to just BE the chief protagonist of anti-aging and my actions are not in concordance with this goal, even though if I simply SAID this is my goal and needed helpers, people WOULD BE ALL OVER TRYING TO HELP ME JUST BECAUSE I SAID I *HAVE* AN AMBITION I'VE BEEN TOO SCARED TO ADMIT FOR ALLTOOMANY-HOW-SO-MANY-SASHA-TARG-YEARS
