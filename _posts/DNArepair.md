"Furthermore, measurements of the by-products of DNA excision repair have been found to be lower in some long-lived, large-bodied mammals than in smaller mammals \[[11](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Froyalsocietypublishing.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1098%2Frstb.2011.0014#RSTB20110014C11),[42](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Froyalsocietypublishing.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1098%2Frstb.2011.0014#RSTB20110014C42)\]. But while there is evidence that larger, longer lived mammals suffer relatively less DNA damage, it is less clear the role that variable rates of DNA repair play in this pattern. Rates of DNA repair do vary between mammal species, at least at the broad scale: for example, rats and mice lack some of the excision repair mechanisms found in primates"
