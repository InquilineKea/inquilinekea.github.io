title: major players in aging
---


Influencing the future trajectories of those who are into aging research:

Laura Deming suggested people not major in biology - but that they major in math/CS/physics instead.

OUTLINE of players in aging who are worth paying far more attention to than average:

- SENS Foundation (changed leadership under Jim O'Neill), seems to take SOME preference towards funding immediately applicable areas of aging
- JP de Magalhaes (the only aging/longevity scientist who publicly says he wants to live forever. Is more open than most scientists are. Has created very large web infrastructures with his research group and does bioinformatics research)
- Aubrey de Grey (important for defining the original track, many mainstream scientists in aging dislike him for odd reasons. Often repeats himself. Still useful to talk to and maintains a lot of the infoflwo int eh community)
- reason @ fightaging (writes fightaging.org, which I've never seen get anything wrong [has great general epistemics]. More dedicated to this than most poeple)
- Aging_Scientist on Twitter (the austrian person), Attila Csordas => generally smart people with high analytical skills who spend much of their time in the area
- Laura Deming - many describe her as "complicated". She seems to have somehow adopted the role of chief protagonist by those who are not pseuds (/r/longevity doesn't discuss her as much as it discusses Aubrey). Unschooled, super-high S/N ratio, seems sphinx-ish, input streams most uncorrelated with input streams of all others. 
- Joanne Peng (some have described her as a "second laura" - very close and heavily trained by laura)
- Genesis Lung (works at BEAM for biotechnology, *really* cares about the issue, though at odd ways orthogonal to how I care)
- Other VCS (eg the Apollo Ventures guy)()
- Jean Hebert (brain regeneration guy mentioned by foresight)
- David Sinclair (is a hype machine. His research lab at Harvard attracts many good people. Some fault him for being overly hyperbolic)
- the cryonics ppl (eg Ashwin Wolf).
- Jose Luis Ricon (smart, unattached, kind of identifies as Aspie-ish). Doesn't care *that* much about aging, but sees it as an interesting intellectual problem. Extremely smart, creating outlines with Adam Marblestone on how to fix the problem
- Pete Estep
- Sarah Constantin (used to run the longevity research institute). Has very high epistemic significance
- Nathan Cheng/Robert Ziman of longevitymarketcap. They seem to know that the ONLY reasonable path forward is to become obsessed with the area, and they do cover a lot of the recent investing in their newsletter which gets lots of reviews
- Vadim Gladyshev (his papers are more worth reading than those of practically any other research scientist in the area). More likely to "get" things than other aging scientists.
- other aging VCs (eg James Peyer of Apollo)

Outline of major people who *care* about aging but are not in the field
- Peter Thiel (is obsessed, though someone really needs to intervene to get him to stop taking HGH. Is willling to fund anything that convincingly demostrates any chance of increases his chances of longevity - many of his talks are about defeaing hte problem of aging)
- Vitalik Buterin
- Balaji
- Christine Peterson (of foresight institute), who *really* cares (knows it's the most important problem to the pt of constantly mentioning it on Facebook as *the* most important thing
- Karl Pfleger (very smart - often asks great questions at foresight). Maintains an aging doc. Used to be more involved (used to throw longevity-associated parties)


Calorie restriction communities:

crsociety.org
livingthecrway.com 
longecity.org
Mike Lustgarten

(crsociety people are great to talk to and REALLY know their nutrition well - esp Michael Rae). But I notice that they don't seem to have evolved much over the last 10 years. 

Other lifehack communities 
Dave Asprey (and his books). Willing to try radical things that others aren't (we need more experimenters)
More biohackers
