title: longevity guide - how to live longer
---

Many many many people before me have written longevity guides (eg the nintil longevity guide). There is still a chance that what I write might be higher-impact than what others have written before me. The reasons being (a) I seem to be more obsessed with this than most people are so this guide may be more of a persistent thing you want to keep looking up than all the other longevity guides. In terms of my precision-recall balance (compared to legit longevity guides), I am much higher on recall and somewhat lower on precision (more willing to consider experimental approaches than Jose Ricon).

I've written a previous guide at https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-do-to-live-as-long-as-possible/answer/Alex-K-Chen . 

One of the great perks of longevity is that doing things better than all others can alone get you 10-15 years of extra life relative to others, which means that spending 6 months obsessed with this can lead to insane returns. The future 100 years from now may be exciting like *nothing else*, so if you are able to delay some types of gratifiction, you may have a chance of seeing the literal transhumanist utopia that transcends all your prior values. 

Supplements to consider: carnosine/taurine/creatine (esp if vegan) - anti-glycation agents, glycine (esp as a precursor to glutathionine), N-acetyl-cysteine, turmuric/curcumin, metformin/rapamycin/acarbose, folic acid/B12 (folic acid and manganese levels seem to be most correlated with longevity), Vitamin D, caffeine/modafinil. Check ITP and Longevity Research Institute for indications of what most reliably works. Some smart people I know (eg Alex Pustov) suggest methylene blue. 

Generally, diet >> exercise. Reducing calorie consumption (and esp protein consumption, AND restricting individual acids like methionine or BCAAs like leucine carry the strongest effects). You can also eat super-healthy (a diet full of carotenoids and several lbs of vegetables in the same way that Mike Lustgarten eats them) - which should get you much further than most people even if you are not calorie-restricted. AFAIK, there aren't many studies done on animals that eat lbs of ultra-healthy vegetables each day (most studies feed animals shitty food). You do not need to eat grains - you can use monounsaturated fatty acids or short-chain fatty acids as a primary energy source on top of a diet primarily composed of fruits and vegetables. 

Repeated exposure to bitter-containing vegetables may acclimatize yourself to vegetables enough such that they taste amazing even when raw (at this point I am even fully capable of eating cabbage raw, if needed). Particularly important vegetables are ones containing allicins (onions, garlic) - sulfur is a HUGE antioxidant, cruciferous vegetables (fewest downsides of any), asparagus, kale (easily contaminated with pesticides). Organic strawberries are the healthiest fruit as they have vegetable-like calorie densities. Spices are good, but avoid imported spices as they may be contaminated with heavy metals. Some CR aficidianos go for consuming peels over consuming the entire fruit, as they have much higher nutrient to calorie ratios.

If you're male, try for 17-alpha-estradiol. A small amount of deuterated heavy water is hormetic. 

see EWG group for vegetables contaminated by organophosphate pesticides.

Wear N95/N99 masks when on the subways or highways. Thomas Talheim has a blog showing that even low-levels of PM1/PM2.5 found in American cities (even NYC/Chicago) are enough to increase inflammation/irritability levels. Do not live within 300 years of a major arterial roadway (esp one populated by trucks or diesel-emitting vehicles). The best air quality is found in US/Canada/ocean-touching areas of Europe. 

Taking rapamycin + metformin + acarbose may also get you in CR-ish similar states, though there are some effects of CR (eg reduced acetyl-CoA levels or reduced ETC flux) that this combination may not simulate. 

Get regular tracking of all metabolites (the more comprehensive the metabolite panel, the better - try to get metabolon or SomaLogic panels if you can, or whatever is used by the Wyss-Corey lab). I found out I was plasmalogen-deficient by getting OpenCures, and NAD+ deficient by getting a jinfiniti NAD+ test. 

Get DEXA scans (dexafit) to track muscle density and bone density over time. 

Get a brain MRI every few years or so (to measure changes in brain volume). 7T over 3T if you can, but any resolution helps. 

Try to do neurofeedback to calm a brain (esp do what you can to calm DMN). Get QEEG to see areas of your brain where you can see more work on. 

Modafinil and caffeine are both antioxidant stimulants that suppress appetite. Methylphenidate and Adderall also suppress appetite and increae energy, but may have neurotoxic effects (Adderall much more so than methylphenidate). There are preliminary studies on transplantation of neurons into Parkinson's brains (grafts) but they are at their early stages and they still haven't recaptured the right circuit. 

Mushrooms (esp ergothionine) have insane amounts of nutrients to calorie ratio. Generally I go for foods that maximize nutrients to calorie ratio. 

Increase deep sleep. There are technologies to play brainwaves at you that can increase it (also play 40Hz to possibly clear out beta-amyloid) - but these technologies may not be developed for a while. 

Get your epigenetic age measured (see morgan levine's interview with foresight institute)

HIIT, read Peter Attia, read Ben Greenfield fitness, read SOME Dave Asprey (but don't do everthing he does). They are not right on all accounts, and not aging-focused as I am, but still have more volume than most who write guides to *not* aging. 

Get an adjustable curved desk if you can, and hold monitor at eye level. Try rolfing to get your posture aligned (make sure monitor is always at eye level to minimize tension).

Being consistently neophilic throughout life may increase neuroplasticity. There are not many consistently novelty-seeking/super-open adults, but Joon Yun is one of them. Psychedelic communities seem to have more of them than most people, as do university towns. 

Staying friends with people in investing/crypto related communities can be a way to massively increase your wealth without trying (but this is risky). I know many people who have gotten rich off of crypto alone - enough to never have to work a stressful job ever again. In that case, you can optimize for online output *and* helping train/mentor a new generation of people who can be more convinced (a la fable of the dragon tyrant) that this IS the most important problem and they should consider working in it as much as they would work hard in school (as Laura Deming knows, school is a giant waste - her not being schooled is the reason why she is so independent)

Think about future trends and try to integrate yourself into them  (eg try to think of a world where human-machine symbiosis is more robust than ever)

I have a guide for avoiding microplastics (see microplastics.md)

Do what you can to directly support/fund biotechnology research (especially the type of "tools development" that will make all biotechnology research faster, more open, less labor-intense, and automatable). Many papers written in the past may be re-written in a high-throughput (do ALL the seq's) type of research. 

OTHER longevity guides: Michael Rae, crsociety.org, livingthecrway.com have many guides.

Provide moral support to biohackers and human guinea pigs - they get so much hate, but they produce so much data that is so valuable to other people, whether or not their interventions work. 

Make sure you stay relevant/important long-run (so consume long content, try to vlog some portions of your life so future people [the people who will be MOST important in developing the technology to solve the longevity thing] ]will be able to see the "young version of you")

If you have kids, consider co-raising them in a commune (qiaochu/alterman/conor white-sullivan consider this). It may significantly reduce the amount of intergenerational trauma that is experienced.

SOCIAL FACTORS:

Spending time with those who are visibly obsessed with longevity will help! I am far more on the diet than exercise side (as Matt Kaeberlein knows, diet is the only way to increase the *cap* on lifespan, not just healthspan), but the exercise side (esp HIIT side) will help too. 

Having diverse friend groups (esp across age) will help insulate you against shocks to the friendgroup. 

It's unclear what the effects of stress (as experienced in western populations) are on longevity (some stress, esp when intermitently placed, may be better than no stress). Having a strong sense of self-direction (and not being trapped) is what psychologically helps the most. Most of your same-age friends may die earlier than you, so it is also important to get close to people across generations (especially by mentoring younger super-receptive people). A cool perk of longevity is that people who really *get it* will never drift, because longevity is always on the back of everyone's minds.

Social stress is weird - you want to escape stupid signalling traps to be free as soon as possible (only Laura Deming stands out in doing this super-early as she was unschooled. )

Try to form an aging cult/a group of people who are as similarly obsessed with aging as I am - it would do *a lot*. AFAIK, even among aging aficionados, I don't think anyone in the world is as obsessed with this as I am...

Peoplein some cities live longer than others (in the US - Vail/Aspen/Breckenridge/Frisco have unusually high lifespans.)
