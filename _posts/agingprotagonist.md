title:  on how the aging protagonist will become rational and stop constantly playing roulette
---



Have you seen Fable of the Dragon Tyrant? The video convincingly shows that at some critical point in the village's self-awareness, society will invest all its resources in trying to slay the dragon faster. 

Why is it so hard to admit that you want to be the transhumanist protagonist of aging? You have a crazy weird background, but shouldn't that make you more endearing rather than less endearing? Once you reach a critical mass of believability, everyone will want to help you, b/c they know that helping you can help them achieve their desires (esp b/c network effects). You may not an expert in many areas of biology, but that is not the most important thing. The most important thing is having high-level awareness of all aspects of the narrative (along with a voice that is *significantly* stronger than the voices of anyone else - scientists have been heavily socialized into not being as visionary as they could be - why can't you just be the visionary?)

If your posts and takes are more entertaining to read than standard academese takes on the mainstream research, they will read you and not the others. They will even go first to you.

To do this requires a strong voice and some "first player mover effects"

You do NOT need to know the details. Go for wisdom over knowledge accumulation. Know enough about the major drivers of progress so that

Be someone who other minds *want to model*. You might have been so fascinated by some minds that you became a bit of a stalker on them, which creates risk of overfitting (esp in historically poor environments). But the best regularization against this is other people, as you have now discovered.

You can make this  *fun* to follow for all of your online fans who will try to make things as easy for you as possible (as you saw earlier today). They can help fill in the gaps for you in areas where you're weak (but where there is plenty of complementary skill level to fill you up on). Again, Laura Deming hasn't invested a lot into the computer-ish technical skills, which frees her mind uniquely for what it is best at. 

being a protagonist, as Laura discovered, does not mean that you are doomed to burnout. Simply having the right developmental trajectory (and being open to the influence of the internet) is a way to make ALL OTHERS want to follow you in the same way they bid up Gamestop. For all the people who ostensibly care about longevity, why do so few have the guts to take up the flames of *being the longevity protagonist*? Even people as smart as Vadim will not publicly take up this banner. Remember that in the long-run, new generations are recognizing that Internet influence is all that counts, and that all IRL is really hooked up with the Internet.

So what is it next for a longevity advocate to do? It is important to have good judgment on *what* the most promising areas are for the future of longevity. Also good judgment on how to inspire new people and where to train said people.
