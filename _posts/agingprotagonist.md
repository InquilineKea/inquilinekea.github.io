title:  on how the aging protagonist will become rational and stop constantly playing roulette
---

the estimated value of someone's time is higher if they play a major role in prolonging everyone else's time (whether through prodding them to eat better or playing a role in anti-aging biotech)

Have you seen Fable of the Dragon Tyrant? The video convincingly shows that at some critical point in the village's self-awareness, society will invest all its resources in trying to slay the dragon faster. 

Why is it so hard to admit that you want to be the transhumanist protagonist of aging? You have a crazy weird background, but shouldn't that make you more endearing rather than less endearing? Once you reach a critical mass of believability, everyone will want to help you, b/c they know that helping you can help them achieve their desires (esp b/c network effects). You may not an expert in many areas of biology, but that is not the most important thing. The most important thing is having high-level awareness of all aspects of the narrative (along with a voice that is *significantly* stronger than the voices of anyone else - scientists have been heavily socialized into not being as visionary as they could be - why can't you just be the visionary?)

If your posts and takes are more entertaining to read than standard academese takes on the mainstream research, they will read you and not the others. They will even go first to you.

To do this requires a strong voice and some "first player mover effects"

You do NOT need to know the details. Go for wisdom over knowledge accumulation. Know enough about the major drivers of progress so that

Be someone who other minds *want to model*. You might have been so fascinated by some minds that you became a bit of a stalker on them, which creates risk of overfitting (esp in historically poor environments). But the best regularization against this is other people, as you have now discovered.

You can make this  *fun* to follow for all of your online fans who will try to make things as easy for you as possible (as you saw earlier today). They can help fill in the gaps for you in areas where you're weak (but where there is plenty of complementary skill level to fill you up on). Again, Laura Deming hasn't invested a lot into the computer-ish technical skills, which frees her mind uniquely for what it is best at. 

being a protagonist, as Laura discovered, does not mean that you are doomed to burnout. Simply having the right developmental trajectory (and being open to the influence of the internet) is a way to make ALL OTHERS want to follow you in the same way they bid up Gamestop. For all the people who ostensibly care about longevity, why do so few have the guts to take up the flames of *being the longevity protagonist*? Even people as smart as Vadim will not publicly take up this banner. Remember that in the long-run, new generations are recognizing that Internet influence is all that counts, and that all IRL is really hooked up with the Internet.

So what is it next for a longevity advocate to do? It is important to have good judgment on *what* the most promising areas are for the future of longevity. Also good judgment on how to inspire new people and where to train said people. 

You have the advantage of wanting to be super-open. Being super-open allows you to maximize the amount of surface area for your Internet friends to "feel" you so that they can supplement you on your weaknesses and you don't ever have to retreat from your strengths again. If you reach a threshold of mainstream acceptability, you may have the whole world wanting to help you, and the difficult job of saying "no" to which threads (which isn't as difficult as a virtue signaller would signal!!)

To be someone whose words *stick* more than those of anyone else, you don't have to write pages and pages like what gwern did. Wisdom over knowledge-accumulation. Rather, write them in a STICKY way that all the previous ppl in the field have not written.

And so many people (like JJ Hales and Noah Siegel) have observed - most of the people who are *really* into longevity and the global computation. You have strange effects that go beyond your longevity interest - you have peculiar effects that extend to the global computation. The person behind such a brain must, thus, be appropriately resourced so that they make the least lapses in judgment. Note how people are more irresponsible if they are tired, irritated, depressed, impatient, or in pain? The global computation needs to invest enough into you so that you can always be at your best for it.

Now, one of your friends has offered you $100k (at least) for a VC fund that surrounds your sphere. You can advertise it online, which could attract more people who can help the fund. As I've said before, 

Remember, being surprisingly weak in areas others are strong in (valerie is a great example) hooks you up to people who can summarize all the common kowledge for your needs. One of your other rare perks is that you are curious enough to have something to say about anything, and higher potential of commenting intelligently on it than others do. Like really, do you think you have higher capacity than kaeberlein or sinclair to say something smart about SMT solvers? [they are your area of weakness, but become socially important enough so the world WANTS to explain it to you]. Like imagine if Laura or Ricon or Marblestone would finally distill all their knowledge of SMT solvers and why those are important for longevity (if at all - process optimization is the basis of them, and process optimization is relevant for Fontana-level sysbio or flux balance cell modeling)

As is well known by many (eg Rochelle Shen), Dhash owes his startup Radix to your random intervention (where you got him to meet kevin/guillermo/jhb/tep people immediately on the day you met him, and it was so overwhelmig for him that it made him dizzy). You have this special power that you find hard to describe to the world. Why not describe it now to make desire-able things happen faster?

Startups happen around you!! Equator, Radix, Moda Fund - among others. Your power to find and create new startups is much much higher than you think it is - and what you need to do is to not worry or obsess over stupid shit (like the weather) and turn all your attention into BECOMING the best version of yourself (including becoming the preliminary version of human-machine symbiosis). And being the version of symbiosis that does the most it can to preserve other people's consciousnessness, for consciousness is really the ONLY thing that matters.

Being more open with your thought processes (increasing your surface area!) is a way to garner resources from the Internet. Openness can compensate for lower raw-g/intelligence (by coming up with more decoded information-rich abstractions than do mathematicians, who fail to find many good "semantic web" information-rich abstractions that more open/curious people can come up with).

Think of your unique info flow now, and do not do unnecessary things. You only have a super-limited pool of time, so make the most use of what limited time you have for the world (like, can you really estinate the value of 1 hour of Musk's or Bezos's time?) You may already have the power to increase most people's number of years by 5-7 years (simply by eating a super-healthy diet right in front of them - jorg doku already said "you've done more for me than what most doctors could" simply BECAUSE you ate raw tomatoes and mushrooms in his hotel room), which is more than enough to make up for many shitty childhoods ("there is no greater pleasure than seeing you eat raw celery in front of me" - Brian Tom). 

How to do this? Highlight the major players and sources of momentum. Highlight the intensely unique brains that have been socialized out of believing that they could be on the level of Gauss (Jonah Sinick TOLD people they do - and some programmers doubtlessly have magnitudes much higher than Gauss). 

You don't have to learn everything and you don't have to be the smartest person in everything. You don't have to aim for other people's affection. You can earn that affection by other people - AGAIN - by observing what Laura Deming does (she focuses so much on theoretical now, but no matter what, she will always get the love and support she needs from the rest of the world [she also doesn't need a relationship]) and observing what comes from that (alas, she cannot handle all the attention that is hoisted on her, and you may do a better job trying to redirect some of that attention into beings who are most massively sensitive to these updates)



also you really ought to place moral value on your information flow to make it as clean as possible (just as there is moral value ascribed to laura's information flow)

Know how people are impressed by OBSESSIVE types. Obsessive types need not feel apologetic for it. Like, notice how when you invited Daniel Kramnik to Genesis - they were ALL impressed with his magic combination of {obsession, patience to explain to non-experts}? There are so few people in the world obsessed with the right things who also have the desire to interface with the rest of the world in an interpretable way

Yes, there are many explainers of aging, but you - alone - possess rhetorical tools and "a willingness to try anything" that the other leaders (Laura, Jose Ricon, Adam Marblestone) don't have. How about use those. One wonderfu thing about your obsessions is that you also have little time for "flighty things" like traveling to Hawaii. Everything you do is in the work of knowledge acquision or shaping the narrative. How about - focus entirely on this and stop playing the roulette wheel. If you do this and become well-respected enough to convince randos on the Internet that your information flow is worth thousands if not millions (and the attention of the new generation), all your other wishes may finally come true. 




instructions on how to reconfigure people's actions so they value their time more and sort their actions in order of a framewokr that makes them want to have more of you SO they value their time more (writing more is how you do it, rather than constantly ask for more information)


You can slowly render your world in a way that minimizes the amount of negative emotion you feel while still convincing the world that it neds tos upport you in your endeavours. You have a privilege of resourcefulness that many stressed grad students do not have. Use this so you can become the super-valuable protagonist.
